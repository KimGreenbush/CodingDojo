# [Coding Dojo](https://www.codingdojo.com/)

I attended the Full-Stack bootcamp at Coding Dojo from August 2020 to November 2020.

The *three* full-stacks I learned were:
- **Python, Django, SQLite**
- **C#, ASP.NET, MySQL**
- **MERN: MongoDB, Express, Reactjs, and Node.js**

As well as web fundamentals:
- **HTML**
- **CSS**

These are all the assignments and projects I worked on while attending the bootcamp.
